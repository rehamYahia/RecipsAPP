### An Application that gets All  Meals Categories and gets all meals contains this category from rest API and when you select a meal the application go to the detail screen to display all description of this meal and when you use the search bar to search for the category all data contains this category will get.
### End Points:
## List all meal categories: www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php
## Filter by Category: www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood
## Lookup full meal details by id: www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=52772
## I use several technical tools for this application:
- Rest Api using retrofit
- MVVM Pattern
- Navigation Component
- Coroutine
- Dagger-hilt
- Room
- State Flow
- coil
- Material Design
## The application contains three screens I will display it and explains the screens how work:
## The first screen is the splash screen:
## The second screen is the home screen:
