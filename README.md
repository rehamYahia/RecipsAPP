### End Points:
#### List all meal categories: www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php
#### Filter by Category: www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood
#### Lookup full meal details by id: www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=52772
### I use several technical tools for this application:


- Rest Api using retrofit.
- MVVM Pattern.
- Navigation Component.
- Coroutine`.
- Dagger Hilt.
- Room.
- State Flow.
- Coil.
- Material Design.
